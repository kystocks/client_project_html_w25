            <p>At the University of Michigan Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), we are committed to
                supporting your mental health and well-being throughout your academic journey. Our team of licensed
                mental health professionals provides confidential counseling services, including individual therapy,
                group sessions, and crisis intervention to help you navigate personal challenges, academic stress, and
                emotional concerns. Through our embedded model, CAPS counselors are available within specific schools
                and colleges, making mental health support more accessible where you study and learn. We offer
                innovative workshop series on topics like stress management, mindfulness, and healthy relationships, as
                well as our popular "Wellness Wednesdays" programming that provides practical tools for maintaining
                emotional balance. Our online self-help resources and virtual counseling options ensure you can access
                support when and where you need it most. CAPS also coordinates with other campus resources and community
                providers to ensure comprehensive care that addresses your unique needs. By engaging with CAPS services,
                you can develop effective coping strategies, build resilience, and maintain your emotional well-being
                while pursuing your academic goals. </p>

                <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We
                    are inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work
                    productively, and connect meaningfully with others.

                    UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services,
                    and University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For
                    information about UHS, please visit the UHS website.

                    CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural,
                    multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access
                    care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to
                    offer both in-person and virtual services.

                    Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are
                    available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the
                    right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.

                    CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor
                    via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.

                    Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews
                    and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our
                    annual reports.

                    The CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the
                    confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone,
                    which has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to
                    contact us.</p>
